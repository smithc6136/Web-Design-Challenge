    <h2>Discussion of Scatterplot:</h2>
    This scatterplot compares latitude to wind speed in miles per hour for various cities as of 01/05/2017. 
    Overall we see a slight positive correlation in the data
    meaning that wind speed generally increases as latitude increases. 
    However, because the correlation is weak we know that latitude is not a great indicator of wind speed.
