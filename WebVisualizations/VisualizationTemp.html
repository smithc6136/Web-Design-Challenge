    <h2>Discussion of Scatterplot:</h2>
    This scatterplot compares latitude to max temperature in Fahrenheit for various cities as of 01/05/2017. 
    Overall we see a negative correlation in the data, although there is some deviation in the middle. 
    The data reveals that max temperature tends to increase as negative latitudes approach zero. 
    For positive latitude, max temperature tends to decrease as latitude increases. 
    Overall, we see that temperatures tend to be higher the closer the city is to a latitude of zero 
    (a.k.a. the closer the city is to the equator).
